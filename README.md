# Hey 👋

My name is Renata Menezes 👩🏽BR

I'm a Nutritionist graduated from UNIP 🎓 and future Developer Full-stack Java!👩🏻‍💻
My experience in the area of health has aroused in me the desire to innovate and make a difference in society.
From my first contact with logic and programming, I realized that it is possible to change the world through technology. Since then, I have sought to improve my technical and behavioral skills! Soon, I'll be a Java Developer!🌎

I'm passionate about solving problems and learning. Always open to new challenges and ready to face changes.
