# Hey 👋

My name is Renata Menezes 👩🏽BR

I'm a Nutritionist graduated from UNIP 🎓 and future Developer Full-stack Java!👩🏻‍💻
My experience in the area of health has aroused in me the desire to innovate and make a difference in society.
From my first contact with logic and programming, I realized that it is possible to change the world through technology. Since then, I have sought to improve my technical and behavioral skills!
I'm currently participating in Generation Brasil's Bootcamp, where I've learned to work with various technologies such as Java, SQL, Spring Framework and HTML / CSS / Javascript.
Soon, I'll be a Java Developer!🌎
